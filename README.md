## Tutorial

### Forking the Repository
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account and open it in **GitHub Codespaces** for easy access and experimentation.
- Alternatively, clone it locally if you're working outside GitHub.

### Running the Script
- After forking or cloning, you need to ensure all required dependencies are installed. This will be handled by the script, so just follow the on-screen prompts.

### Using the Contribution Generator
- When you run the script, it will ask for:
  - A **repository URL**: This is the GitHub repository where you want to add the fake contributions.
  - A **folder name**: It will create a new folder inside your project to store the generated files.
  - **How many contributions** you want to make.
- The script will generate fake commits, each with a **random commit message** chosen from a predefined list.

### Verifying Real Contributions
- To confirm that the contributions are legitimate and real, check the actual commit history of the repository.
- View the commits by navigating to the "Commits" section of the repository or follow this link: [Commit History](<https://github.com/imscruz/FakeConc/commits/main/>)
