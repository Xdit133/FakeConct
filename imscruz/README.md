# Fake Contribution Generator

A simple script that generates fake contributions for a GitHub repository to showcase activity, without actually altering the project in any meaningful way. This is **NOT** intended for spamming or malicious activity. The purpose is purely for learning, demonstration, or fun!

## ðŸš¨ WARNING ðŸš¨
Before you begin, ensure that **Git** and **Python** are installed on your machine.


This project is meant for **educational purposes only**. It is **NOT** to be used for spamming GitHub profiles or misleading others. Please do **NOT** use this for unethical purposes. If you need evidence of real contributions, refer to the actual commits made during testing.

### Suggested Use:
- Fork the repository and experiment with it in a safe, private environment like **GitHub Codespaces** or your own local machine.
- **DO NOT** use this for misleading or malicious activities, as it violates GitHub's terms of service.

## Installation

Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone <repo_link>
cd <repo_name>
```

Install the required dependencies:
- This project requires `colorama` to be installed, which will be handled automatically by the script.
- Run the following command to install the requirements:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the script:
- To begin generating fake contributions, simply run:

## Tutorial

### Forking the Repository
- Fork this repository to your GitHub account and open it in **GitHub Codespaces** for easy access and experimentation.
- Alternatively, clone it locally if you're working outside GitHub.

### Running the Script
- After forking or cloning, you need to ensure all required dependencies are installed. This will be handled by the script, so just follow the on-screen prompts.

### Using the Contribution Generator
- When you run the script, it will ask for:
  - A **repository URL**: This is the GitHub repository where you want to add the fake contributions.
  - A **folder name**: It will create a new folder inside your project to store the generated files.
  - **How many contributions** you want to make.
- The script will generate fake commits, each with a **random commit message** chosen from a predefined list.

### Verifying Real Contributions
- To confirm that the contributions are legitimate and real, check the actual commit history of the repository.
- View the commits by navigating to the "Commits" section of the repository or follow this link: [Commit History](<https://github.com/imscruz/FakeConc/commits/main/>)
